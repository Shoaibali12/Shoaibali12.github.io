	&quot;"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who ponts out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the main who is actuall in the arena, whose face id marred bt dust  and swear ans blood ; who dtrives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effory without error and shortcomin; but who does actually strives to dot the deeds; neither know victory&nbsp; nor&nbsp;dedfeat.&quot;</p>
